<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Aidan. ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p align="center">I'm a junior software developer from Co. Mayo, Ireland.
I am currently learning ReactJS and working on developing my first entrepreneurial role as a developer [mymo.ie](https://mymo.ie). I started Code Institute's Fullstack software development course in March of 2020 in which I received a Distinction Grade, which can be found [here](https://www.credential.net/24f10ef4-61c9-4464-825c-e0d953136364).
I am looking to change my career to software development and am working hard to do so.
